# cssr

This is just my take on the ever popular CSS reset files that are everywhere.

I have basically taken the parts I consider necessary from files that have been updated and revised over time, to create a single file.

It is not perfect by any means, and it is not ground-breaking either, it is just basically for reference for myself.
